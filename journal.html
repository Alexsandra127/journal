			Well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting palces
			on the way: Walla Walla, WA, Magic City, ID, and truth or Consequences, NM.

			I saw some Burma Shave style sings on the side
			of the road today:
			</p>
		   <blockquote>
				Passing cars,<br> 
				When you can't see,<br>
				May get you,<br>
				A glimpse, <br>
			    Of eternity.<br>
			</blockquote>
			<p>
			I definitely won't be passaing any cars. :)

			My first day of the trip! I can't believe I finally got everthing packed and ready to go.
			Because I'm on a Segway, I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me: cell phone, iPod, digital camera,
			and a protein bar. Just the essentials. As Lao Tzu would have said, <q>A journey of a thousand miles begins
			with one steep Segway.</q>
